\begin{multicols*}{2}
A character’s ability to use a particular type of weapon in combat is represented by weapon feats.

There are 6 levels of proficiency with each weapon, listed below along with the abbreviations used for them in the tables in this chapter:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Non-Proficient (‘N’)}
	\item{Basic Proficiency (‘B’)}
	\item{Skilled Proficiency (‘S’)}
	\item{Expert Proficiency (‘E’)}
	\item{Master Proficiency (‘M’)}
	\item{Grandmaster Proficiency (‘G’)}
\end{itemize}

All characters except start out non-proficient with all weapons other than those that they spend their starting weapon feats to gain proficiency with.

\section{Starting Weapon Feats}\index[general]{Starting Weapon Feats}
All characters start with two weapon feats at \nth{1} level except \iref[class:Dwarf]{Dwarves} and \iref[class:Fighter]{Fighters} who start with four. These weapon feats must be immediately spent on basic weapon proficiency on weapons usable by the character.

A character may not spend more than one first level weapon feat on the same weapon.

\section{Gaining Weapon Feats}\index[general]{Gaining Weapon Feats}
All characters gain an additional weapon feat at \nth{3}, \nth{6}, \nth{9}, \nth{11}, \nth{15}, \nth{23}, \nth{30}, and \nth{36} level. Dwarves and fighters also gain weapon feats at \nth{19}, \nth{27}, and \nth{33} level. These feats are not gained immediately upon increasing in level. Instead, the character must undergo training in order to spend the feat or feats.

Each weapon feat is spent to increase the level of expertise that the character has with a particular weapon.

When a character wishes to spend a weapon feat in order to increase their level of expertise with a weapon, they must find a trainer. Ideally this trainer will have a higher level of expertise than the character does, but it is possible—providing the character has at least basic skill with the weapon—for the character to train with their peer.

Once the character has found a suitable trainer, they must start their training. The length of time that the training must take is listed on \fullref{tab:Learning Weapon Feats}, along with the weekly cost of the training if the trainer is an NPC.

\autoref*{tab:Learning Weapon Feats} also shows the chance of the training being successful. This check is made half way through the training, at which point it will be apparent to the trainer whether the student is progressing or not. Unscrupulous trainers may keep quiet and keep taking money from the student for the rest of the duration anyway, but most trainers will warn the student that the training isn’t working out and give them the choice of continuing the training until the end or abandoning it at that half way mark (and therefore saving the money they would have paid for the second half of the training.

In either case, the weapon feat is only considered to have been used if the training was successful.

If the training was not successful, the character gets a +10\% cumulative bonus on all future training for the same level of expertise in the same weapon.

\example{Gretchen currently has a basic level of expertise with a mace, and has recently gone up a level and gained a weapon feat. She wishes to use this feat to increase her level of expertise with maces to skilled.

She hunts for a teacher, and finds a variety in the city, charging different prices based on their own skill level.

Deciding that economy is best, Gretchen goes for a relatively cheap trainer—a skilled mace trainer who charges 250 gp/week.

Going from basic expertise to skilled expertise will take two weeks of training, and will (with this trainer) have a 50\% chance of success.

She spends 250 gp for the first week of training, and at the end of the week her player rolls for success—and gets a 79, which fails.

Gretchen’s trainer takes her to one side and confides in her that it’s going to take more than the initial two weeks for her to get the hang of the new techniques, and asks her if she wants to continue the training.

Gretchen decides to complete the training, so pays another 250 gp and completes week 2. She now has a +10\% bonus next time she tries to lean skilled proficiency with maces.

When the training is finished, Gretchen signs up for another two weeks of training with the same teacher, consoling herself that although the training is taking longer than expected, at least four weeks with this trainer isn’t costing her any more than two weeks with a more expensive trainer would have.

At the end of the first week of this new set of training, Gretchen’s player rolls again, and gets a 54. This would normally be a failure since the chance of success is 50\%, but the +10\% bonus for the completing the previous training turns it into a success.

At the end of the second week—her fourth week in total—Gretchen becomes skilled with maces, after having spent a total of 1,000 gp and four weeks training.

In this case, Gretchen re-did the training immediately after the first unsuccessful attempt, but even if she had waited weeks or months between attempts she would still have got the +10\% bonus on the second roll because she completed the first attempt.}

\section{Effects of Proficiency}
As a character gains more proficiency levels with a weapon, they will usually do more damage with it. The damage done by a weapon is listed for each proficiency level in the detailed weapon descriptions in this chapter.

Increasing in proficiency level with a weapon will usually also result in an increased attack bonus with that weapon and an armor class bonus against one or more opponents when using that weapon.

Some types of weapon have special abilities such as the ability to deflect attacks or the ability to ensnare opponents, which can be used only by characters with a high enough level of proficiency.

\section{Opponent Types}
Although some weapons are equally effective against any opponent, weapons intended for warfare are often more effective against other opponents armed with melee weapons; whereas weapons intended for hunting are often more effective against unarmed opponents. \fullref{tab:Weapon Feats} lists each weapon effectiveness against each type of opponent separately.

Note that opponents wielding missile weapons use the same values as opponents who are completely unarmed or using natural attacks such as claws.

\section{Weapon Abilities}\index[general]{Weapon Abilities}\label{sec:Weapon Abilities}
The various weapon abilities listed on the previous tables are described below.

\textbf{AC Bonus:} When using the weapon, a character gains the listed armor class bonus against the given number of incoming attacks each round. For example, an entry of “-2 vs 3” means that the wielder of the weapon gains a –2 bonus to their armor class against three incoming attacks. The character can decide which attacks to use the bonus against, so they can save the bonus for use against a tougher opponent who is attacking later in the round rather than having to use them against a weak opponent who happens to be attacking first. However, the character must announce which attacks they wish to use the bonus against before attacks are rolled.

These armor class bonuses must be used against attacks coming from opponents of the relevant type, regardless of what type of opponent the character is attacking. For example, a character who is skilled with a normal sword gets a –2 AC bonus against one attack from an armed opponent per round, even if the character is actually attacking an unarmed opponent.

When a character uses two weapons in combat, they get whichever AC bonus is most beneficial against each incoming attack. The bonuses do not stack.

\example{Black Leaf is wielding a normal sword in her main hand and a club in her off hand. She has expert proficiency with each weapon, although because the club is in her off hand it counts as having only skilled proficiency.

The sword gives her –2 AC vs 2 attacks by armed opponents. The club gives her –1 AC vs 2 attacks by armed opponents and –1 AC vs 2 attacks by unarmed opponents.

The bonuses against armed opponents don’t stack, so each round Black Leaf has a total of –2 AC against two attacks by armed opponents and –1 AC against two attacks by unarmed opponents.}

\textbf{Breakable:} A breakable shield weapon is more fragile than a normal weapon and has a chance of breaking when used.

Whenever the character using it rolls the exact number needed to hit an enemy or an enemy rolls the exact number needed to hit the character, there is a chance that the shield weapon will break.

The Game Master should roll a d10, add the magical bonus of the shield weapon itself and subtract the magical bonus of the weapon (if any) that struck it. If the modified total is 5 or less, then the shield weapon has broken. When broken, it will still provide its armor class bonus, but can no longer be used to make attacks.

\textbf{Charge:} When a weapon with the charge ability is used after the wielder’s mount has charged 20 feet or more in the round, the weapon does double the normal amount of damage.

\textbf{Deflect:} If a number is listed for this ability, the wielder of the weapon can attempt to deflect a number of incoming attacks equal to this number by making a saving throw vs. death ray against each of them. A successful saving throw means that the attack is deflected and the character takes no damage.

The character can decide which attacks to try to deflect, so they can save the attempts for use against a tougher opponent who is attacking later in the round rather than having to use them against a weak opponent who happens to be attacking first. However, the character must announce which attacks they wish to try to deflect against before attacks are rolled.

These deflection attempts must be used against attacks coming from opponents of the relevant type, regardless of what type of opponent the character is attacking. For example, a character who is skilled with a normal sword gets a deflection attempt against one attack from an armed opponent per round, even if the character is actually attacking an unarmed opponent.

When a character uses two weapons in combat, the deflection attempts given by each weapon do not stack. The character gets to use a number of attempts equal to the higher number granted by either of the weapons.

\textbf{Delay:} When the wielder of a weapon with the delay ability hits an opponent with it, the opponent must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or automatically lose initiative in the following round.

Some projectiles can only delay opponents at listed ranges.

\textbf{Disarm:} The wielder of a weapon with the disarm ability can choose to try to disarm their opponent instead of attacking for damage. The character’s player must announce that a disarm attempt is being made before rolling any dice for the attack. If the attack hits then the target of the attack must make a \iref[sec:Dexterity]{Dexterity} check (see \fullref{sec:Ability Checks}) with the listed penalty to their effective \iref[sec:Dexterity]{Dexterity} or drop their weapon.

\textbf{Double Damage:} If the wielder of the weapon rolls the number indicated or higher on the dice, before modifiers, and the attack hits the target after modifiers, then the attack does double the normal amount of damage.

\textbf{Entangle:} Any target that the weapon hits may become delayed, slowed or entangled depending on their hit dice or level compared to the proficiency level of the weapon wielder. See \fullref{tab:Entangling Weapons} for details. The target must make a saving throw vs. death ray with a penalty based on the proficiency of the wielder when first hit in order to avoid the effect. If this fails, the target is affected but may repeat the saving throw each round until they make it, at which point they are no longer affected.

An entangled target cannot attack, cast spells, or move.

\begin {table}[H]
  \caption{Entangling Weapons}\label{tab:Entangling Weapons}
  \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\bfseries}M{.6in}YYYY}

		16+ or more & +5 & Delay & Delay & Delay\
  \end {tabularx}
\end {table}

\textbf{Hook:} The wielder of a weapon with the hook ability can choose to try to hook their opponent and trip them instead of attacking for damage. The character’s player must announce that a hook attempt is being made before rolling any dice for the attack. If the attack hits, the weapon causes only minimum damage and the target must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or fall \iref[sec:Prone]{Prone}.

\textbf{Knockout:} Any target that the weapon hits may become delayed, stunned or knocked out depending on their hit dice or level compared to the proficiency level of the weapon wielder. See \fullref{tab:Knockout Weapons} for details. The target must make a saving throw vs. death ray with a penalty based on the proficiency of the wielder when hit in order to avoid the effect. If this fails, the target is affected as normal by the delay, stun or knock out.

An enemy who is knocked out will be unconscious for 1d100 rounds before waking up.

\begin {table}[H]
  \caption{Knockout Weapons}\label{tab:Knockout Weapons}
	\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\bfseries}M{.6in}YYYY}

		Up to 1 & +0 & K/O & K/O & K/O\\
		1+ to 3 & +1 & K/O & K/O & K/O\\

		12+ to 16 & +5 & Delay & Delay & Stun\\
		16+ or more & +5 & Delay & Delay & Delay\
  \end {tabularx}
\end {table}

\textbf{Off-Hand:} A weapon with this ability does not suffer the normal to-hit and proficiency penalties when used in the wielder’s off hand.

\textbf{Poison Save:} If the weapon with this ability is poisoned, the target takes the listed penalty on their saving throws against the poison.

\textbf{Projectile Range:} This weapon is either a missile weapon or can be used as one. The three numbers given are the short/medium/long ranges of the weapon.

A range marked with a (H) indicates that with great skill and effort it can be hurled at an opponent. Such hurling of weapons uses the character’s \iref[sec:Strength]{Strength} modifier rather than their \iref[sec:Dexterity]{Dexterity} modifier. Because such weapons are not aerodynamic and do not fly well, opponents who are not surprised by the attack may make a saving throw vs. death ray in order to take half damage.

However, the first time in each fight that an opponent has the weapon thrown at them, they must roll for surprise at normal chances due to the unexpected nature of the attack.

\textbf{Set:} The wielder of this weapon may brace it against a charging foe. The wielder automatically gains initiative over the charging foe, and if they hit then they do double normal damage.

\textbf{Skewer:} If the weapon hits an opponent with the listed number of hit dice (or levels) or less, the opponent may be skewered if the attacker so chooses.

The attacker must let go of the weapon, and it remains caught in the opponent for 1d4+4 rounds, doing 1d6 damage each round. If the opponent spends a round removing the weapon, they take double damage that round but are then free of the weapon.

\textbf{Strangle:} If the wielder of the weapon rolls the number indicated or higher on the dice, before modifiers, and the attack hits the target after modifiers, then the target of the attack must make an immediate saving throw vs. death ray with the listed penalty or be paralyzed and die after 1d6+2 rounds of strangulation. Should the target be freed from strangulation, they will remain paralyzed for 2d6 rounds.

If the wielder of the weapon does not roll the required numbers but still hits the target, the target is affected as though the weapon were an entangling weapon with the same saving throw penalty.

\textbf{Stun:} A weapon with the stun ability will stun any opponent it hits that is approximately the same size as the wielder of the weapon (or smaller) unless they make a saving throw vs. death ray.

Some projectiles can only stun opponents at listed ranges.

\textbf{Two Attacks:} Weapons with this ability can be used to attack twice each round, as if the attacks were made by a primary hand and off hand weapon, but without the normal off hand penalties to their to-hit rolls and proficiency level.
