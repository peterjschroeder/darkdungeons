All sapient creatures in Dark Dungeons have an alignment. This represents the philosophical outlook of the creature. There are two opposing philosophical alignments that a creature might have: Order or Chaos.
\section{Order}\index[general]{Order}\label{sec:Order}
Creatures aligned with order, usually referred to as “Lawful” creatures, enjoy stability, routine, and predictability. They are likely to live in large cities with well-defined social mores and caste, class systems or other forms of social stratification where everyone knows their place and there is little social mobility. Such societies can be benevolent and protective or oppressive and tyrannical in nature, but in either case one’s position in society and feeling as if one belongs to a group are often seen as more important than individuality.
\section{Chaos}\index[general]{Chaos}\label{sec:Chaos}
Creatures aligned with chaos, usually referred to as “Chaotic” creatures, are quite the opposite. They prefer novelty and change to stodgy routine, and are more likely to live in small family groups or clans than in cities. Position and respect in such groups is often very changeable and linked to individual traits such as strength or honor. Chaotic societies can be bastions of altruism, freedom and individuality or brutal dog-eat-dog places where only the strongest survive.
\section{Neutral}\index[general]{Neutral}\label{sec:Neutral}
Many creatures don’t wholly embrace either of these philosophies, preferring something in-between the two. These creatures are usually simply referred to as “Neutral”.
