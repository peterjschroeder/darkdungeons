Time travel can be a tricky subject to get your head around, so any explanation of it needs to start with the fundamentals, before moving on to specific examples. The basics of time travel are straightforward, but things can get very complex very quickly — especially if multiple time travelers are jumping around based on each other’s actions.

\section{The Nature of Time}
Time is absolute, not relative. It ticks by inexorably regardless of whatever time travel happens. In other words, if you go to the past and stay there for a day before returning to the present, the present will have advanced a day since you left.

This is a very important principle for anyone who wishes to travel in time. The present is the only “real” time and all other times are measured relative to it. The past is a set of echoes of the present, and the future is a set of potential presents, but neither of them are “real” in the same way that the present is. The present is privileged in that way. The present is the only place that contains real people with real free will, capable of changing history.

\section{Time Lines}\index[general]{Time Lines}
Get a sheet of paper, and draw a horizontal line across the middle of it. This line represents the present. Now draw a vertical line down the middle of the paper. This line represents the future (the portion of the line above the present) and the past (the portion of the line below the present). In theory, and if we had a big enough sheet of paper, we could draw the past line back as far as the beginning of the universe and the future line as far as the end of the universe.

This vertical line represents an ordered sequence of everything that has happened and everything that will happen, and it is called a time line. The present intersects it, and as time ticks on the present moves steadily forward — in our diagram that means it’s moving steadily up the page from the past to the future.

In the same way that there is a single objective present, there is a single time line that represents the present’s history and future. This is known as the true time line, and consequently the part of it in the past is true history and the part of it in the future is the true future.

So far, this is all rather simple and static. However, the difference between the time line and the present is that there is as single present that moves, but there are multiple time lines representing different sequences of events.

Imagine someone, we’ll call her Kate, traveling back to the past to change history. Kate starts at the point where the present and the true time line intersect, we’ll say that that is 9:00 a.m. on a Monday morning, and she goes back to the past. Let’s say that she goes back to the year 500 (don’t worry about what year numbering system we’re using; we’re basically just using “the year 500” as the name of an arbitrary point in the past).

Now as Kate is traveling back in time, on our diagram she’s effectively moving down the page along the time line that we’ve drawn. Doing that traveling takes a small amount of time, so by the time she’s arrived in the year 500 the present has moved on slightly. It’s now 9:03 a.m., since her journey took three minutes. 

At 9:00 a.m., true history didn’t include the sudden appearance of Kate in the year 500, but now at 9:03 a.m. it does. Kate has changed history. Now it might be that in the year 500 Kate appeared, had a quick look around, and then disappeared again. If that were the case, the change to history would be insignificant. It would still exist, but history as of 9:03 a.m. would still be pretty similar to history as of 9:00 a.m. However, it may be that after Kate appeared she went around assassinating important people and generally mucking about; and this causes large changes to history. Maybe the consequences of her actions are such that an entire empire that would otherwise have formed no longer does so. So at 9:00 a.m. the empire exists in the present, but as of 9:03 a.m. it suddenly no longer does. Kate has changed history and wiped it out. This would be a very significant change to history.

So according to our diagram, what has happened?

\subsection{Branches}
What has happened is that Kate travels down the page on the true time line until she gets to the year 500. Then, her arrival causes a new time line to be created. It’s identical to the existing time line at all points prior to Kate’s arrival in the year 500, but at that point it diverges off from the original time line since different events happen. It may only diverge a very tiny amount if Kate doesn’t disturb much, but if Kate’s appearance has a big impact then it will diverge a great deal.

However, two very important things happen. Firstly, Kate is in this new time line rather than in the original one; and secondly, as of 9:03 a.m. in the present, this new time line becomes the true time line. The old time line, the one that Kate left, is no longer the true time line. That’s now an alternate time line. It was the true time line up until 9:03 a.m., but now anyone looking back in history books will discover that it never happened. Instead, according to history books, the new time line is what happened. 

Effectively, what has happened is that Kate’s arriving in the past has created a new time line which includes whatever she did there; and at 9:03 a.m. the present jumped from the old time line to the new one. History changed out from under people.

Let’s say that it takes Kate three days to do whatever she’s doing in the past to change history, and then she travels back to the present. She doesn’t travel back up the same time line she traveled down. Instead, she travels up the one she’s now on. When she arrives back in the present (and don’t forget that the present will have moved on for three days while she’s been away), she’ll discover that history now records her sudden appearance in the past; her three days of actions; and her subsequent disappearance.

(The full rules of time travel as slightly more complicated than this, and Kate’s return trip would have caused more than one new time line to branch off the existing one, but we’ll ignore those complications for now other than to mention that they exist.)

So from Kate’s point of view, she was in the present in a situation she didn’t like; she went back into the past and changed history; and returned to the present to find that history had indeed changed. Depending on how informed Kate is, she may or may not be aware of the way time lines work, so she may or may not be aware of how she created a new time line and the present snapped onto it.

But what about the view of other people? What about the view of Robbie, a fellow time traveler who stayed in the present while Kate did her trip? And what about the view of Eve, someone else in the present who isn’t a time traveler?

From the point of view of Robbie, Kate disappears at 9:00 a.m., and then three minutes later at 9:03 a.m. everything suddenly changes. He still remembers the “old” history, but the world now corresponds to the “new” history instead.

From the point of view of Eve, Kate disappears at 9:00 a.m. Three minutes later at 9:03 a.m. the world changes, but Eve doesn’t notice this because she changes along with the rest of the world. As far as she is concerned, the “new” history has always been history, and she has no memory that three minutes ago history was different to what it is now.

Clearly there is a strong distinction between people like Robbie who are sensitive to changes in the time line, and people like Eve who are not.

\subsection{The Anchored, Drifters and Alts}\index[general]{The Anchored, Drifters and Alts}\label{sec:The Anchored, Drifters and Alts}
Time travel forever changes you. If you’ve never done it then you’re just one of the masses, and you’re at the mercy of those who can do it. You might have grown up to be a famous wizard and gained substantial power and prestige, but one change to the time line and you could find yourself with a changed history in which you never learned magic and instead you became a glassblower making a modest income.

What’s worse is that your memory will have changed with history and you’ll always remember being a glassblower. You’ll remember your apprenticeship and career the way it now retroactively happened and you’ll have no idea that you actually have a different past.

But that’s not the worst case scenario. The worst case is that someone could change history so that you died in childhood, or that you were never born at all. Your entire existence could be erased, and there’s nothing you can do to prevent it or to stop it; or even to realize that it’s happening.

However, once you have time traveled for the first time this changes. From that point on you are protected from changes in history. This protection only applies to you personally, not your belongings or family — but it does mean that when history changes you will no longer change with it.

To use our wizard example from above, you would suddenly find that no-one else but you (and other time travelers) remembers that you are a wizard, and you’re now in a glassblowing workshop instead of in your tower. You’re still a wizard though and you still remember your old history as a wizard even though everyone else seems to remember you growing up as a glassblower.

Even in the worst cases where history changes to include your death or not include you at all you still continue to exist and still continue to remember the old history. It’s just that now people remember you dying as a child or don’t remember you at all, and there’s no official record of you existing as an adult.

Of course, the changes caused by someone traveling in time might be much smaller and subtler than that. For example, if someone goes back and kills Emperor Artaxes III and Emperor Artaxes IV takes over the empire five years earlier than happened in the old time line it’s quite likely that you won’t be affected by the change at all until you look in a history book and discover that a few things aren’t quite how you remember them from the last time you looked in that same book.

Because of this ability to remain static while history changes around them, time travelers borrow terminology from nautical travelers and refer to someone who has traveled in time at least once (whether they continue to actively travel in time or not) as being “Anchored”. Similarly, those people who have never traveled in time and who are therefore at the mercy of history changes caused by time travelers are referred to as “Drifters” because they move around with the metaphorical tides of history. 

There is also a third type of person. When a time traveler travels to the past or the future, they will meet other people there. However, these people aren’t quite “real” in the same way that people in the present are. Those in the past are mere echoes of real people, and those in the future are only potential people. 

Although people in the past and future seem to behave like the real versions of those in the present, they are not quite the same, at least as far as time travel is concerned. People from the past or future, who are usually called “Alts” (short for “Alternatives” — because they’re alternative versions of people from alternate time lines) by time travelers, are never anchored, even if their real equivalent in the present is. Effectively, they’re just part of the time line rather than having true free will; although their behavior will be indistinguishable from that of real people. However, because they are merely part of history (or the future) any “time travel” that they do is also merely part of history or the future. When an alt travels in time they do not cause the time line to branch — their time travel is simply part of the existing time line.

For example, if Kate travels back in time by a week and visits a place she knows that she went to a week ago, she will meet one of her alts — an Kate of a week ago. This alt will act and react in the same way that the real Kate would, but it is not the real Kate. It is an alternate Kate from a different time line (in fact she’s from the time line that Kate just created by traveling to the past). 

Since the real Kate is a time traveler, and has been for longer than a week, her alt will also appear to be a time traveler. However, if Kate persuades her alt to travel further into the past and change history, this will not happen. Her alt will disappear as normal for time travel, but the time line will not change and show her appearing in the past. Philosophers studying time travel are divided about the significance of this.

Some think that because the alt isn’t a “real” person they simply disappear rather than time traveling. Others think that the alt does create a new time line in the same way that someone from the present does when time traveling, but that because the alt is not from the present the time line fails to become the new true time line and as such people who are anchored (such as the real Kate) never get moved to it. Whichever the answer is, it has no practical effect on time travelers.

\section{Traveling in Time}\index[general]{Traveling in Time}
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, when people travel in time the sequence of events is slightly more complicated than just spawning off a single new time line when they arrive. Traveling in time will usually involve three time lines, not just two:

\textbf{Time Line O:} The original time line that you were on before you started traveling. This time line includes what would happen if you stayed in your starting time and didn’t make your journey. 

\textbf{Time Line D:} A time line identical to the one from which it was created, to the point where you disappeared, but which branches off at that point; having an alternate future in which you disappeared at your point of departure.

\textbf{Time Line A:} A time line identical to the one from which it was created, to the point where you appeared, but which branches off at that point; having an alternate future in which you appeared at your point of arrival.

\subsection{The Rules}
Each time you travel in time, whether into the past or the future, the following things happen in order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{A new time line (D) is created, branching from the time line you started on (O) at the point of your departure. You are moved onto this new time line, and if your original time line was the true time line and your departure point is in the present or the past then this new time line becomes the new true time line and everyone else in the present is moved onto it too.}
	\item{Your journey through time is tracked forwards or backwards along the time line that you are now on. If your point of arrival is in the present, you are immediately moved from the time line you journeyed along to the true time line.}
	\item{A new time line (A) is created, branching from the time line you are now on at your arrival point, and you are moved onto this new time line. If your point of arrival is in the present or the past, and the time line you traveled along was the true time line, then this new time line becomes the new true time line and everyone else in the present is moved onto it too.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Permutations}\index[general]{Permutations}
The eight possible permutations of these three rules are summarized in \fullref{tab:Time Travel Permutations}.

	\thead{Depart from} & \thead{Arrive in} & \thead{Effects}\\
	Past & Past & Time line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure. You are moved to Time Line D, and if Time Line O was the true time line then Time Line D replaces it as the new true time line and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line D. You travel along Time Line D, and then Time Line A is created, branching off Time Line D at your arrival point. You are moved to Time Line A, and if Time Line D was the true time line then Time Line A replaces it as the new true time line and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line A.\\
	Past & Present & Time line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure. You are moved to Time Line D, and if Time Line O was the true time line then Time Line D replaces it as the new true time line and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line D. You travel along Time Line D. As soon as you arrive in the present, you are moved to the true time line, whichever one that is. Then Time Line A is created, branching off the true time line at your arrival point. Time Line A becomes the new true time line, and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line A.\\
	Past & Future & Time line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure. You are moved to Time Line D, and if Time Line O was the true time line then Time Line D replaces it as the new true time line and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line D. You travel along Time Line D. When you arrive, Time Line A is created, branching off Time Line D at your arrival point. You are moved to Time Line A.\\
	Present & Past & Time Line D is created, branching off Time Line O in the present. Time Line D becomes the new true time line, and everyone in the present is moved to it (including you). You travel along Time Line D to your destination time, whereupon Time Line A is created, branching off Time Line D at the point of your arrival. Time Line A becomes the new true time line, and everyone in the present is moved onto it.\\
	Present & Future & Time Line D is created, branching off Time Line A in the present. Time Line D becomes the new true time line, and everyone in the present is moved to it (including you).

	Future & Past & Time line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure and you are moved to it. You travel along Time Line D to your destination time, whereupon Time Line A is created, branching off Time Line D at the point of your arrival and you are moved to it.\\
	Future & Present & Time Line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure and you are moved to it. You travel along Time Line D to your destination. As soon as you arrive in the present, you are moved to the true time line, whichever one that is. Then Time Line A is created, branching off the true time line at your arrival point. Time Line A becomes the new true time line, and everyone in the present is also moved to Time Line A.\\
	Future & Future & Time line D is created, branching off Time Line O at your point of departure and you are moved to it. You travel along Time Line D to your destination time, whereupon Time Line A is created, branching off Time Line D at the point of your arrival and you are moved to it.
  \end {tabularx}
\end {table}
\begin{multicols*}{2}

\subsection{Splitting the Party}
The above permutations assume that you are on your own or traveling in a group that all continue to travel together. However, it is possible that a group of people will travel together from the present to the same point in either the future or the past, and then will split up with some time traveling again and others remaining behind.

When characters do split up in this manner, those who are left behind are moved into Time Line D along with those who travel on, although they will remain in their current time in Time Line D while those who travel on journey to a different time.

This is not a problem providing all the characters have a means by which to return to the present, as they will each be moved to the true time line when that happens. However, if anyone is stranded without a means of returning to the present it will be impossible for their companions to “rescue” them because any attempt to return to their time will result in a new time line being created and the character who is rescued will be an alt of the stranded character from that new time line rather than the character themselves.

\section{Example Scenarios}
The rest of this chapter consists of a number of worked examples of time travel occurring, showing how the rules work in a number of increasingly complex situations. In each one, we start with the situation, then show what will happen from the point of view of the characters involved, and then show the detail of why that happened according to the rules of time travel. 

\subsection{Let’s Kill the Emperor}
Kate goes back in time to kill Emperor Artaxes, then returns to the present. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Kate disappears from the present. Shortly afterwards, history changes to one in which Emperor Artaxes died — killed by a mysterious stranger (who happens to match Kate’s description). When Kate returns to the present the following day she discovers the changes to history that she caused.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Before Kate sets off, true history follows time line O, which is one in which Emperor Artaxes lived to an old age. Technically when Kate leaves the present, time line O is replaced by time line D1 which branches off time line O in the present, but since the only difference between them is that time line D1 has Kate disappear from the present and time line O doesn't, we can pretty much ignore this for game purposes.

Kate travels back into the past of time line D1 (which is the same as the past of time line O) and arrives in Artaxes’s time. Her arrival causes time line A1, in which she appears and kills Artaxes, to be created, branching off time line D1 at the point of her arrival; and this becomes the new true history. Therefore, in the present, everyone is shunted from time line D1 to time line A1, and this is interpreted as history having changed. Note that only other time travelers who are anchored will notice the change in history. Drifters will move to the new time line and as far as they remember Artaxes was always killed in this manner. They don’t have any memory of the new time line at all.

Time line A contains Kate’s killing of Artaxes, but it doesn’t contain her return to the present. When she sets off back to the present, time line A1 (in which she doesn’t set off) is replaced by time line D2 (in which she does) and this becomes the new true time line. When she arrives in the present, time line D2 (in which she doesn’t arrive) is replaced by time line A2 (in which she does). In each of these cases, since the new time line is created from the true time line and its point of divergence is in the present or the past the new time line becomes the true time line and everyone in the present is shunted onto it. In practice, since the differences between these time lines are so small they can probably be ignored for game purposes.

If we want to be really precise, from the point of view of people in the present, history O is replaced by history D1 when Kate leaves, and then history A1 when she arrives. This is then replaced by history D2 when she leaves the past on her return journey, and then history A2 when she arrives back in the present. However, for simplicity we can ignore histories D1, D2 and A2 unless there are fellow time travelers acting at the same time as Kate. For a simple trip like this it’s simpler to just say that the original history which doesn’t include the death of Artaxes is replaced by one that does include his death. 

\subsection{The Grandfather Paradox}
Kate decides to go back in time and kill her own grandmother before she gets pregnant, then returns to the present. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Shortly after Kate departs, history changes to one in which her grandmother was killed before she had any children. This is a history in which Kate was never born. The following day Kate returns to the present to discover that there’s no record of her birth and none of the things she remembers from her childhood actually happened. No-one remembers her existence at all except for her fellow time travelers.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Before Kate sets off, true history follows time line O. When she sets off, time line D1 is created and becomes the new true history, but the change is inconsequential so we can ignore it for game purposes. When she arrives in the past, time line A1 is created from time line D1, and this becomes true history. Time line A1 is the one in which her grandmother is killed before having children, and therefore it is significantly different to time line O. The significant difference being that in time line A1, Kate was never born. This doesn’t mean that Kate ceases to exist though.

Kate’s return trip creates time lines D2 and A2 as in the first scenario, and both of these become the new true history when created, but since each contains only inconsequential changes they can be ignored.

When Kate arrives in the present, she is now in a time line in which she was never born – and therefore there’s no record of her. People who previously knew her in time line O have never met her in this new time line, so drifters fail to recognize her even if they were formerly her friends or enemies. Only other anchored people such as fellow time travelers will remember that they used to know her in a previous time line.

\subsection{Killing the Traveler as a Baby}
Kate has been making enemies; and fellow time traveler Robbie decides to go back and kill her as a baby before she first time traveled. What happens? 

\subsubsection{Summary}
Shortly after Robbie departs for the past, history changes. Kate still physically exists but people no longer recognize her or remember her. When she looks up her own records she discovers that she died as a baby. When Robbie returns to the present, he discovers that Kate is still there, despite having “died as a baby” – and she is not happy with him.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
As usual, the original time line is O and this changes to D1 when Robbie sets off and A1 when he arrives, with both becoming the new true history.

Time line A1 includes Kate being killed as a baby. However, this isn’t actually the real Kate. Instead, it’s Kate’s alt that Robbie kills.

If Kate were a drifter, then her alt being killed in time line A1 would mean that when everyone else is shunted over to time line A1 as it becomes the new history, she would disappear instead. However, she’s not a drifter – she’s anchored. Because of this, she is shunted over to time line A1 anyway, despite the fact that she doesn’t belong in this time line.

As usual, Robbie’s return journey creates two new time lines, D2 and A2, but these are inconsequential and can be ignored.

\subsection{Cheating the Lottery}
Kate decides she wants to get rich, and time travels forward to next week in order to see which ticket wins the Grand Lottery that her kingdom is holding. Traveling forward, she climbs a tree and from her vantage point sees that the lottery is won by Robbie with ticket number 169. She writes down the number before returning to the present, at which point she buys that ticket before Robbie has chance to do so. What happens? 

\subsubsection{Summary}
A few days later when the lottery is drawn at the festival, ticket number 169 wins and Kate claims the prize. Looking round, she doesn’t see herself in the tree watching the draw.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
As always, the original time line is O. In this time line, Kate doesn’t time travel and a week later Robbie wins the lottery. When Kate sets off into the future, this creates time line D1, one in which she disappears, and this replaces time line O as the true time line.

When she arrives in the future, time line A1 (in which Kate appears and climbs the tree and Robbie wins) is created, branching off from time line D1. However, because this branch is in the future rather than the present or past, time line A does not become the true time line.

Kate setting off back to the present causes time line D2 to branch off time line A1, but since time line A is not the true time line D2 won’t become the true time line either.

When Kate arrives in the present, the first thing that happens is that she is shunted from time line D2 back to time line D1, because time line D1 is the true time line. Then time line A2 branches off from time line D1 in the present, becoming the new true time line.

Kate then advances along time line A2 as normal, in which time line she wins the lottery. Because Kate was only ever in the tree in time line A1, not D1, she is not in the tree in the future of time line A2.

\subsection{Crossing the Streams}
Kate goes back in time to kill Artaxes III and change history. However, her fellow time traveler Robbie waits with a history book watching for the change. When he sees that killing Emperor Artaxes III doesn’t change history in a way that it to his liking (Artaxes III is succeeded by Artaxes IV who is just as bad), Robbie decides to go deeper into the past and prevent the empire from forming in the first place by manipulating Artaxes I so that he never unifies the disparate kingdoms. Because this takes some time, Kate arrives back in the present before he does. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Shortly after Kate leaves for the past, Robbie notices that history has changed. While Artaxes III was killed, Artaxes IV took over and the empire remained strong. Robbie then leaves too, and shortly after his departure history changes a second time. Now the empire never formed in the first place. Kate returns to the present expecting to find that the empire collapsed after the death of Artaxes III, but instead finds that neither he nor the empire ever existed. Two weeks later, Robbie returns and is able to explain to Kate what happened.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
As always, the original time line is O and when Kate sets off this is replaced by time line D1 which becomes the new true time line. When she arrives in the past, time line D1 is replaced by time line A1, in which she kills Artaxes III. Because time line D1 was the true time line, time line A1 now becomes the true time line. Meanwhile, in the present, Robbie has been shunted from time line O to time line D1 and then to time line A1. He looks in the history book and sees that time line A1 is not to his liking, so he travels back to the founding of the empire.

When Robbie sets off, time line A1 is replaced by time line D2 as the true time line. Time line D2 is the same as time line A1 in that it includes Kate arriving in the past and killing Artaxes III, however this isn’t the real Kate. Because Kate is not in the present, she isn’t shunted into the new true time line. Instead, the Kate that appears and kills Artaxes in time line D2 is an alt of Kate that simply appears rather than having come from anywhere. The real Kate remains in time line A1.

Robbie travels back along time line D2 and arrives at his destination. This causes time line A2 (in which Robbie manipulates Artaxes I into never creating the empire) to branch off from time line D2 at that point. Because time line D2 was the true time line, time line A2 becomes the new true time line.

Since the empire is never formed in time line A2, it does not contain a copy of Artaxes III and consequently does not contain the appearance of an alt of Kate that kills him. Neither does it contain the real Kate; she’s still in time line A1.

Kate is oblivious to Robbie’s actions, since she’s still in time line A1. She leaves to return to the present, causing time line D3 to be created, branching off time line A1. Although this branch is in the past, because time line A1 is no longer the true time line, time line D3 does not become the true time line.

When Kate arrives in the present she is immediately shunted to time line A2, the current true time line, and time line A3 branches off it at this point becoming the new true time line. Because time line A3 is based on time line A2, it doesn’t contain Artaxes III and Kate’s appearance in the past. Instead it contains a history in which the empire was never formed because of Robbie’s appearance in the earlier past. Again, this is not the real Robbie but an alt, because the real Robbie is still in time line A1. He doesn’t get shunted to A3 when it becomes the new true time line because he isn’t in the present. Kate is somewhat confused by the nature of time line A3, but she suspects it has something to do with Robbie and waits for him to return.

After a couple of weeks in the past, Robbie has finished his work and he sets off on a return journey. When he departs for the present, this causes time line D4 to branch off from the time line he is on, A2, but since A2 is no longer the true time line (it’s currently time line A3) time line D4 doesn’t become the new true time line. When he arrives in the present (which has moved on by a couple of weeks) he is immediately shunted from time line D4 to time line A3, before time line A4 branches off and everyone is shunted on to that one. Everyone ends up on time line A4 in which Robbie went back and manipulated Artaxes I into not creating the empire in the first place, and in which Kate disappeared and then reappeared a day later.

\subsection{Picking up Past Me}
Kate decides it would be fun to go back in time, pick up her past self, and bring her past self back with her to the present. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Shortly after Kate leaves for the past, history changes to indicate that she mysteriously disappeared while younger. Shortly afterwards, Kate returns with someone who looks very like her, but a bit younger. The two have no special mental or magical connection, however; they’re effectively just identical twins. 

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Kate starts in time line O, and creates time line D1 when she sets off to the past and time line A when she arrives. As usual, these both become the new true time line because O was. When Kate meets her younger self in time line A1, this isn’t her real self but her alt.

When Kate sets off back to the present with her alt, this creates time line D2 (in which Kate mysteriously disappeared in the past) which becomes the new true time line, and when she arrives in the present this creates time line A2 (in which she disappeared in the past and reappeared in the present with a “twin”) which also becomes the new true time line.

Despite Kate’s alt not being a true time traveler because she is only an alt, she can travel to the present with the real Kate because the real Kate is a true time traveler.

\subsection{Looking for Future Me 1}
Kate decides to go forward a single day into the future and pick up her future self to bring back with her to the present. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Kate soon returns, disappointed that she was completely unable to find her future self.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Kate starts in time line O, and when she sets off this creates time line D1 which becomes the new true time line.

Although we normally gloss over time line D1, this time it is important. Time line D1 is based on time line O with the difference that in time line O Kate continued to exist but in time line D1 she vanished when she set off to time travel.

When she arrives in the future, this creates time line A1 which does not become the new true time line even though D1 was because its branching off point is in the future. Since time line A1 is based on time line D1 in which Kate disappeared, there is no alt of Kate in time line A1 for the real Kate to find.

Kate sets off home, creating time line D2, but since this branches off time line A1 in the future time line D2 doesn’t become the new true time line. When she arrives back at the present, she’s immediately shunted onto the true time line which is currently time line D1. This creates time line A2, which becomes the new true time line.

\subsection{Looking for Future Me 2}
In an attempt to succeed where scenario 7 failed, Kate travels forward in time by a day and spends an hour sitting in a park before returning to the present. She then waits for a day and visits the same park hoping to meet herself. What happens? 

\subsubsection{Summary}
Kate disappears, and then reappears an hour later. The following day she goes to the park but is disappointed to discover that her past self never turns up.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Kate starts in time line O, and when she sets off for the future this creates time line D1 which becomes the new true time line. Time line D1 is similar to time line O except that it includes Kate’s disappearance. When Kate arrives in the future, this creates time line A1 in which Kate disappears and then reappears and sits in the park. Because this branches off from time line D1 in the future, it does not become the true time line.

When Kate leaves the future, time line D2 is created from time line A1, and again this does not become the true time line. Upon arrival in the present, Kate is immediately shunted back onto time line D1 because this is the true time line, and then time line A2 branches off and becomes the new true time line.

Kate goes to the park in time line A2, but fails to meet herself because the time lines in which she was in the park were time lines A1 and D2, and A2 branched off D1 rather than branching off one of those.

\subsection{A Little Help from My Friends}
Kate is sitting in an inn with Robbie and tries to get around the previous restriction. She asks Robbie to travel forward a day into the future and pick up her future self from the park, bringing her future self back to the inn, promising that she’ll wait in the inn for him to arrive. What happens?

\subsubsection{Summary}
Robbie disappears and shortly afterwards arrives with someone who looks like Kate. The two have no special mental or magical connection, however; they’re effectively just identical twins. Kate, Robbie and the other Kate leave the inn without bothering to wait around for the pick up to happen, because by now they’re savvy enough about time travel to know that even if they do wait Robbie won’t turn up.

\subsubsection{Detailed Explanation}
Robbie starts in time line O, and when he sets off this creates time line D1 in which he disappears and Kate waits in the inn. Time line D1 becomes the new true time line.

When Robbie reappears, this creates time line A1 in which Kate is still in the inn and Robbie has disappeared and reappeared. Because this branches off from time line D1 in the future, it does not become the new true time line.

Robbie meets Kate’s alt (the real Kate is still in the present) and leaves for the present. This creates time line D2, which doesn’t become the new true time line because it branches off from time line A1 in the future. Robbie arrives in the present, with Kate’s alt, and they are immediately shunted to the true time line, which is currently time line D1. His arrival means that time line A2 is created and becomes the new true time line.

Time line A2 contains Robbie’s disappearance and subsequent reappearance with Kate’s alt, but since it is based on time line D1 rather than time line A1 or time line D2, it doesn’t contain Robbie’s arrival and stay in the future.

Because time line A2 doesn’t contain Robbie’s arrival in the future, there’s no reason for Kate, Robbie and Kate’s alt to wait around, and all three of them leave the inn.
